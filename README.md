# College Touring
Provides the information of the colleges and the most efficient routes between colleges as the user can choose where to go and receive the best efficient trip.

# Installation
Qt Creator must be installed before running this application.

Execute the main.cpp to run the application on Qt Creator.

# Requirements
The team is to write a software that reads data and stores into an ordered 
or unordered map (not using the map or unordered map STL or the QT map). The 
underlying data structure of the map is the choice of the college. The map 
should store either the college names, states, number of undergraduates and/or
the souvenirs. Your program must have the ability to hold the names of at least 
20 college campuses (the initial data contains 11 campuses) and their 
corresponding souvenirs (up to seven per campus). Your program will be used to 
allow prospective college students to plan their college experience. Your team 
will need to provide the ability to modify information related to the souvenirs 
(such as adding new souvenirs, changing a price of a souvenir, or deleting a 
souvenir).    Write at least 10 agile stories (including description, tasks,
test scenarios, and story points) before any software development.
